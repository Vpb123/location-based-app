# location-based-app
Django location based application

It uses geo django and postgres with postgis extension for storing spatial database.
All the dependencies were installed using osgeo4w
OSGeo4W is a binary distribution of a broad set of open source geospatial software for Windows environments (Windows 10 down to XP).
Location of all the shops in Mumbai has been using data.json imported from overpass turbo
I set the location of user as Bandra west by default so it will show all the nearby shops.
